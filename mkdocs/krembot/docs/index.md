# Welcome to Krembot wiki

KREMEBOt is a compact and light weight development platform. It uses [photon microprocessor](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi) , which allow KREMEBOt to be flashed remotely, and also have cloud based capabilities. This, alongside with RoboTican's KREMEBOt API create a very quick and easy platform to develop code and deploy it. This means you can be focused only on writing your code.

Each client gets his own account. Under that account grouped together one or more KREMEBOts. Because KREMEBOt communicate with cloud when it's on, the client can at any time monitor its state, control certain functions remotely and more. Writing code is fairly easy with [Particle desktop](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/) or [cloud](https://build.particle.io/build/new) IDE. Once code is ready, [you can flash it remotely](https://github.com/robotican/krembot/tree/master/flash) to a single KREMEBOt, or multiple ones.
