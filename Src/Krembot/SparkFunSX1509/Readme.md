Here you'll find the Arduino code used to interface with the SX1509 I2C  
16 I/O expander. There are functions to take advantage of everything the  
SX1509 provides - input/output setting, writing pins high/low, reading  
the input value of pins, LED driver utilities (blink, breath, pwm), and  
keypad engine utilites.  

Development environment specifics:  
	IDE: Arduino 1.6.5  
	Hardware Platform: Arduino Uno  
	SX1509 Breakout Version: v2.0  

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the  
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
