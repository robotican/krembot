*
* \mainpage Description
* Krembot is a compact and light weight development platform. It uses<a href="https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit"> photon microprocessor</a>,
* which allow Krembot to be flashed remotely, and also have cloud based capabilities.
* This, alongside with RoboTican's Krembot API create a very quick and easy platform
* to develop code and deploy it. This means you can be focused only on writing your code.
*
* Each client gets his own account. Under that account grouped together one or more Krembots. 
* Because Krembot communicate with cloud when it's on, the client can at any time monitor its state,
* control certain functions remotely and more. Writing code is fairly easy with<a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/">Particle * desktop</a> or<a href="https://build.particle.io/build/new">cloud</a> IDE.
* Once code is ready, you can <a href="https://github.com/robotican/krembot/tree/master/flash">flash it remotely</a> to a single Krembot, or multiple ones.
